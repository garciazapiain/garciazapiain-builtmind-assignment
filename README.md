# TypeScript Redux CRUD Application

This application is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app built with TypeScript, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. It fetches data from a public API and allows you to add, update, and delete items.

## Features

- Built with the TypeScript template for strong typing and improved developer experience.
- Integrated with Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive design.
- State management handled by Redux, utilizing Redux Toolkit for efficient, scalable development.
- API integration using Axios to fetch data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder).
- CRUD operations:
  - **Create**: Add a new item to the list through a form. This simulates a POST request and adds the item to the Redux state.
  - **Update**: Each item is editable, opening an inline form or modal. Changes are submitted to update the Redux state.
  - **Delete**: Each item has a delete button to remove it from the list.
- Responsive design ensured by Tailwind UI components.
